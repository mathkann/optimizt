<ul>
The field of optimization is
concerned with the study of maximization and minimization of mathematical
functions. Very often the arguments of (i.e., variables in) these functions are
subject to side conditions or constraints. By virtue of its great utility in
such diverse areas as applied science, engineering, economics, finance,
medicine, and statistics, optimization holds an important place in the
practical world and the scientific world. Indeed, as far back as the Eighteenth
Century, the famous Swiss mathematician and physicist Leonhard Euler
(1707-1783) proclaimed that <i>... nothing at all takes place in the Universe
in which some rule of maximum or minimum does not appear.</i> The subject is so
pervasive that we even find some optimization terms in our everyday language. 

<P>
Linear Optimization is so large a subject that it cannot
adequately be treated in the short amount time available in one quarter of an
academic year. In this course, we shall restrict our attention mainly to some
aspects of linear optimization, such as model formulation, duality theories, and algoritm
complexities. 

<P>
Linear Optimization often goes by the name <i>Linear
Programming</i> (MP). The word &quot;Programming&quot; should not be confused with
computer programming which in fact it antedates. As originally used, the term
refers to the timing and magnitude of actions to be carried out so as to
achieve a goal in the best possible way. Linear Programming is one of the
central quantitative decision models in Management Science and Operations
Research. Highlights of this year's topics are <b><i><span style='color:#993300'>Economic pricing, compressed sensing,
on-line linear programming, core of game, financial Decision and risk management, dynamic resource allocation,
and their computations</span></i></b>,
which you would learn during the process of the course.

<P>
<B>What background is needed for MS&E 310?</B>
This is an advanced master or doctoral-level Core course in the MS&amp;E Department.&nbsp;
No prior optimization background is required, although it should be extremely helpful
have some.&nbsp; In this sense, it is not intended to be an elementary course.  Students who have
taken courses such as MS&amp;E 211 will see some
repetition of material.  This is unavoidable, but MS&amp;E 310 is intended
to be more <i>theoretical and advanced</i> than MS&amp;E 211.

<P>Students in this course will be expected to possess a firm
background
in the following mathematical subjects: multivariate differential
calculus; basic concepts of analysis; linear
algebra and some matrix theory. Familiarity with computers
and computer programming might also be useful. Above all, it is essential
to have a tolerance for
mathematical discourse plus an ability to follow - and sometimes devise one's own
- mathematical proofs.&nbsp; These play a much larger role in the course
than computer work.
