MS&E 311 emphasizes classical theories, efficient algorithms and recent progresses in
Linear and Nonlinear Optimization---one of the central mathematical decision models in Management Science
and Operations Research. MS&E 311 is a continuation course of MS&E211. Although there are some minor overlaps with MS&E 211, 
MS&E 311 covers more advanced application models, in-depth optimization theories, and state of the art algorithms
which were not able to be covered by MS&E211.

The field of optimization is
concerned with the study of maximization and minimization of mathematical
functions. Very often the arguments of (i.e., variables in) these functions are
subject to side conditions or constraints. By virtue of its great utility in
such diverse areas as applied science, engineering, economics, finance,
medicine, and statistics, optimization holds an important place in the
practical world and the scientific world. Indeed, as far back as the Eighteenth
Century, the famous Swiss mathematician and physicist Leonhard Euler
(1707-1783) proclaimed that <i>... nothing at all takes place in the Universe
in which some rule of maximum or minimum does not appear.</i> The subject is so
pervasive that we even find some optimization terms in our everyday language. 

<P>
Optimization is so large a subject that it cannot
adequately be treated in the short amount time available in one quarter of an
academic year. In this course, we shall restrict our attention mainly to some
aspects of nonlinear programming and discuss linear programming as a special
case. Among the many topics that will <i>not </i>be covered in this course are
integer programming, network programming, and stochastic programming. 

<P>
Optimization often goes by the name <i>Mathematical
Programming</i> (MP). The latter name tends to be used in conjunction with
finite-dimensional optimization problems, which in fact are what we shall be
studying here. The word &quot;Programming&quot; should not be confused with
computer programming which in fact it antedates. As originally used, the term
refers to the timing and magnitude of actions to be carried out so as to
achieve a goal in the best possible way. Mathematical Programming is one of the
central quantitative decision models in Management Science and Operations
Research. Highlights of topics are <b><i><span style='color:#993300'>Information
Aggregation, Economic
Equilibrium, Pricing Model, Core of Game, Financial Decision and Risk Management, Sparse and
Low Rank Opimization and its Computations</span></i></b>, which you would learn during the process of the course.

<P>
<B>What background is needed for MS&E 311?</B>
This is an advanced master or doctoral-level Core course in the MS&amp;E Department.&nbsp;
No prior optimization background is required (although it should do no
harm to have some).&nbsp; In this sense, it is an <I>introductory </I>course,
but it is not intended to be an elementary course.  Students who have
taken courses such as MS&amp;E 211 (or MS&amp;E 310) will see some
repetition of material.  This is unavoidable, but MS&amp;E 311 is intended
to be more <i>theoretical and advanced</i> than MS&amp;E 211.

<P>Students in this course will be expected to possess a firm
background
in the following mathematical subjects: multivariate differential
calculus; basic concepts of analysis; linear
algebra and some matrix theory. Familiarity with computers
and computer programming might also be useful. Above all, it is essential
to have a tolerance for
mathematical discourse plus an ability to follow - and sometimes devise one's own
- mathematical proofs.&nbsp; These play a much larger role in the course
than computer work.
